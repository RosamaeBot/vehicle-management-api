# Requirements

## Task 1 :heavy_check_mark:

Design a Fleet management API that for MVP will only cater for cars, but in the future will manage other Fleet types like boats, bikes, caravans etc.

API should expose endpoints to list Fleets, add new Fleet, delete Fleet and update Fleet.

## Task 2 :x:

Build a simple console application that uses the API above to generate hourly report.

## Expectations

- The solution must be in the form of a visual studio project ready to run. We are looking for use of latest .net technologies, coding patterns, practices and principles.
- Data may be persisted in any way you like. In memory is sufficient.
- Unit/Integration testing is encouraged
- Please push your code to a repo (e.g. Github/bitbucket).
